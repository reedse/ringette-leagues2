# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Ringette League Hub (Placeholder Name)

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2025-04-08

## 1. Overview

* **App Name:** Ringette League Hub (Placeholder - final name TBD)
* **Description:** A web application designed specifically for ringette leagues, providing a centralized and intuitive platform for viewing league statistics, game data, player profiles, team information, game schedules, and managing video clips.
* **Tagline:** Your League's Stats and Clips, All in One Place. (Placeholder)
* **Problem Solved:** Addresses the current lack of a dedicated, user-friendly, all-in-one platform for accessing, viewing, and managing ringette league data (stats, schedules) and associated video highlights/clips.
* **Platform:** Web Application (Desktop/Mobile Web)

## 2. Target Audience

* **Players:**
    * **Demographics:** Primarily U12-U19 age range.
    * **Goals:** Track personal performance/stats, view game highlights/clips sent by coaches, compare stats.
    * **Pain Points:** Difficulty accessing consolidated personal stats, lack of easy access to relevant game video clips, information scattered across different sources.
* **Coaches / Team Admins:**
    * **Goals:** Efficiently manage team rosters and stats, analyze game/player performance, use video clips for player development, scout opponents, communicate game schedules.
    * **Pain Points:** Time-consuming manual stat tracking, no central platform for integrated stats and video, cumbersome video sharing methods, difficulty disseminating schedules/information.
* **Parents:**
    * **Goals:** Easily find game schedules, follow their child's performance and stats, track team standings and progress.
    * **Pain Points:** Difficulty finding reliable and up-to-date information on schedules, scores, and stats.

## 3. Key Features (MVP Scope)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include the following core functionalities:

* **User Authentication:** Secure login/signup for Players and Coaches/Admins.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Different views and permissions for Players vs. Coaches/Admins.
* **Game Schedule Page:** Viewable by all users, manageable (add/edit/delete entries) by Admins.
* **Game Listings Page:** Table view of league games (past & upcoming), filterable/sortable. Includes scores, teams, date/time.
* **Detailed Game Page:** Shows final score, involved teams (linking to Team Pages), detailed box score/stats per player (linking to Player Pages), placeholder for video link.
* **Team Listings Page:** View of all teams in the league with basic stats (W-L record, etc.).
* **Detailed Team Page:** Shows team banner, name, record, roster (list of players linking to Player Pages), team schedule/results (linking to Game Pages).
* **Player Profile Page:** Shows player's team banner, name, season stats, game-by-game stats, link to view associated clips (if membership upgraded).
* **Video Clip Viewing (Players):** Access to view specific video clips tagged for the player by their coach (Requires paid membership upgrade).
* **Video Clip Management (Coaches/Admins):** Ability to associate video links with games, define clips (start/end times - placeholder/simplified initially), tag players in clips, add notes, and "send" or make clips visible to specific players on their team.
* **Admin Dashboard (Coach/Admin Role):**
    * Import/Manage Game Data: Input scores and potentially basic stats post-game.
    * Manage Team Roster: Add/remove players from their assigned team.
    * Update Player Stats: Manually adjust/correct player statistics if needed.
    * Update Game Schedules: Manage the team's schedule information.
* **Membership Upgrade:** A mechanism for players to upgrade their account (details TBD) to unlock clip viewing.

## 4. Success Metrics (Initial Ideas)

* User Acquisition Rate (Sign-ups per league/team)
* User Engagement (Logins/week, page views/session)
* Feature Adoption (Stats page views, clip views/sends, admin updates)
* Player Upgrade Conversion Rate (%)
* Data Freshness (Frequency of admin updates)

## 5. Assumptions

* Leagues/teams are willing to adopt and use the platform.
* Designated Coaches/Admins per team are willing and able to consistently input required data (schedules, scores, stats, rosters).
* Users have reliable internet access.
* A suitable solution for video hosting/linking (and potential basic clipping interface) can be integrated.
* A payment processing system can be integrated for player upgrades.

## 6. Risks

* **Data Integrity:** Accuracy and timeliness depend heavily on Admin input.
* **User Adoption:** Convincing leagues/teams to switch from existing methods.
* **Technical Complexity:** Implementing the video clipping/tagging/permission logic.
* **Monetization:** Ensuring the value proposition for player upgrades is sufficient.
* **Scope Management:** Keeping the MVP focused and avoiding premature feature additions.

## 7. Timeline Goal (Initial Phase - First Week)

* Establish basic project structure (frontend/backend repositories, essential configurations).
* Develop visual prototypes/mockups for key screens (e.g., Login, Dashboard/Home, Game List, Player Profile).
* Roughly implement 1-2 core *read-only* features using placeholder data (e.g., display a static list of games or teams).
* *(Note: Full MVP development, testing, and deployment will follow this initial phase and take considerably longer).*

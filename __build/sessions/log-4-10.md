### Enhanced Games Filtering System

*   **Constants and Configuration:**
    *   Created a dedicated frontend constants file (`resources/js/Constants/filters.js`) with:
        *   Filter key constants (FILTER_LEAGUE, FILTER_SEASON, etc.)
        *   Status constants for better type safety
        *   Utility functions for applying and clearing filters
    *   Created a matching backend constants class (`app/Constants/Filters.php`) to ensure consistency
    *   Implemented proper imports in both frontend and backend components

*   **Bugfixes and Filter Improvements:**
    *   Addressed duplicate entries in league and season dropdowns:
        *   Added distinct() selection in GameController database queries
        *   Implemented uniqueness checks with Set in computed properties
        *   Added alphabetical sorting for leagues and chronological sorting for seasons
    *   Changed filtering to use names instead of IDs for leagues and seasons:
        *   Updated GameController to filter using whereHas() relationships
        *   Improved default season selection to use start_date instead of ID

*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Added active filter badges with individual clear buttons
    *   Implemented filter count indicator showing number of active filters
    *   Created togglable debug information section
    *   Added clear indication of applied filters with human-readable names
    *   Improved visual hierarchy of filter components

*   **Code Quality Improvements:**
    *   Implemented utility functions for common operations
    *   Renamed variables for clarity (leagueId â†’ leagueName, etc.)
    *   Improved computed property organization and naming
    *   Added proper sorting of dropdowns (alphabetical for leagues, chronological for seasons)
    *   Enhanced code comments and structure

*   **Performance Optimizations:**
    *   Reduced database queries by selecting only needed columns
    *   Implemented proper relationship eager loading
    *   Added client-side caching through preserveState in Inertia requests
    *   Optimized dropdown rendering with keyed items

*   **Future Enhancements Planned:**
    *   Add search functionality within filter dropdowns
    *   Consider implementing advanced filtering with saved filter presets
    *   Add deep-linking to support sharing filter states via URL

# Session Log: 2025-04-16

## Summary
Today's session focused on implementing Task 9: Payment Integration with Stripe using Laravel Cashier, as well as fixing issues with the broadcasting configuration. The payment integration provides subscription functionality for players to access clips shared by coaches.

## Changes Implemented

### Payment Integration with Stripe
1. Added the `Billable` trait to the User model
2. Created migration files for Cashier tables and columns:
   - Added Stripe-related columns to users table (`stripe_id`, `pm_type`, `pm_last_four`, `trial_ends_at`)
   - Created subscriptions and subscription_items tables
3. Updated the SubscriptionController to handle subscription creation, cancellation, and resumption
4. Created a WebhookController for handling Stripe events
5. Added a dedicated webhook route for Stripe with rate limiting
6. Updated frontend Vue components for subscription management:
   - Improved Subscription/Show.vue to display subscription plans
   - Enhanced Subscription/Checkout.vue to process payment information
   - Added query parameter passing for plan selection
7. Created a ClipPolicy to enforce subscription-based access to video clips
8. Added Gates for subscription-based permissions in AuthServiceProvider
9. Implemented a subscription prompt UI on the Player's Clips page
10. Updated environment variables to use Stripe configuration values

### Stripe Integration Fixes
1. Fixed missing Stripe.js script in app.blade.php for the card element to render properly
2. Addressed database schema compatibility issue with Laravel Cashier:
   - Created a custom Subscription model extending Cashier's Subscription model
   - Added type accessors/mutators to map between 'type' (expected by Cashier) and 'name' (existing column)
   - Overrode the User's newSubscription method to use our custom Subscription model
   - Registered the custom Subscription model with Cashier in AppServiceProvider
3. Added better error handling in the SubscriptionController
4. Improved the Checkout.vue component with more robust error handling and user feedback
5. Added logging to help diagnose payment processing issues

### Broadcasting Configuration Fixes
1. Fixed broadcasting configuration in config/broadcasting.php
2. Added required Reverb configuration settings (REVERB_APP_SECRET)
3. Fixed the Laravel Echo initialization in bootstrap.js:
   - Added missing `cluster` parameter to prevent JavaScript errors
   - Updated the Echo configuration to work properly with Pusher/Reverb
4. Made broadcasting driver configurable between development and production

## Next Steps
- Complete integration testing of the payment flow
- Set up webhooks on Stripe dashboard to connect to our endpoint
- Add email notifications for subscription events (trial ending, payment succeeded, etc.)
- Update documentation for payment processes

## Technical Debt / Issues
- Need to improve error handling for declined payments
- Should consider adding subscription management pages for admins
- May need to implement more granular subscription plans in the future

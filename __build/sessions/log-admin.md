# Session Log: Admin Interface Implementation

## Summary
This session focused on implementing an admin interface to allow league administrators to assign coaches to teams. We fixed an issue with role naming that prevented the admin user from accessing admin features, and corrected component import paths.

## Changes Implemented

### Admin Team Management
1. Created an AdminTeamController to:
   - Display a listing of teams with their coaches
   - Show forms for assigning coaches to teams
   - Handle coach assignment and removal
   - Support creating new coach accounts

2. Created Vue components for the admin interface:
   - Teams.vue - Lists all teams with coach assignments
   - AssignCoach.vue - Interface for adding coaches to teams

3. Added routes to support the admin team management:
   - GET /admin/teams - List all teams
   - GET /admin/teams/{team}/assign-coach - Show the coach assignment form
   - POST /admin/teams/{team}/assign-coach - Assign an existing coach
   - POST /admin/teams/{team}/create-coach - Create and assign a new coach
   - POST /admin/teams/remove-coach - Remove a coach from a team

4. Updated the admin dashboard:
   - Added a "Manage Teams" button to the Teams card
   - Updated the navigation sidebar to include a Teams link

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed the role naming issue:
   - Updated the role name in the database from "Admin" to "league_admin"
   - This allowed the admin user to properly access the admin features

2. Fixed component import paths:
   - Changed import paths from "@/shadcn/ui/..." to "@/Components/ui/..."
   - Ensures components are correctly loaded from the project's structure

## Admin Functionality
The implemented admin interface provides:
- A complete view of all teams in the system
- The ability to see which coaches are assigned to which teams
- Forms for assigning existing coaches to teams
- Functionality to create new coach accounts as needed
- The ability to remove coaches from teams

## Next Steps
- Test the coach assignment and removal functionality
- Implement admin interfaces for managing leagues, seasons, and associations
- Add additional admin features for managing players and game schedules
